I Sharon Farrell Student Number 10581193 declare that the work I have done is my own and I took samples from Paulo ALves but used my own colour schemes and graphics.

I also used the Ionic Framework. 
Many of my feature worked but when I tried to put files at were used in sevefral places in a components folder the App started to break. I did comtinplate removeing it but didnt have time to work the App out again. 
I have the home pages linking to the parite page as this is the first stage in developing the App.
